# Classification Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classification tasks using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The project aims to classify data using various machine learning algorithms. The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison of different classifiers

## Requirements

To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install key dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Classification.ipynb
```

3. Follow the notebook instructions to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Results

The notebook provides accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and visualizations to analyze model performance.
